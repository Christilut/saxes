# saxes

A sax-style non-validating parser for XML.

Saxes is a fork of [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) 1.2.4. All mentions
of sax in this project's documentation are references to sax 1.2.4.

Designed with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in the
browser or other CommonJS implementations.

## Notable Differences from sax.

* Saxes aims to be much stricter than sax with regards to XML
  well-formedness. Sax, even in its so-called "strict mode", is not strict. It
  silently accepts structures that are not well-formed XML. Projects that need
  absolute compliance with well-formedness constraints cannot use sax as-is.

* Saxes does not support HTML, or anything short of XML.

* Saxes does not aim to support antiquated platforms.

* Saxes handles errors differently: it provides a default onerror handler which
  throws. You can replace it with your own handler if you want. If your handler
  does nothing. There is no `resume` method to call.

* There's no `Stream` API. A revamped API may be introduced later. (It is still
  a "streaming parser" in the general sense that you write a character stream to
  it.)

## Limitations

This is a non-validating parser so it only verifies whether the document is
well-formed. We do aim to raise errors for all malformed constructs encountered.

However, this parser does not parse the contents of DTDs. So malformedness
errors caused by errors in DTDs cannot be reported.

Also, the parser continues to parse even upon encountering errors, and does its
best to continue reporting errors. However, once an error has been encountered
**you cannot rely on the data given to you by event reporters.**

## Regarding `<!DOCTYPE`s and `<!ENTITY`s

The parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute
values: `&amp; &lt; &gt; &apos; &quot;`. It's possible to define additional
entities in XML by putting them in the DTD. This parser doesn't do anything with
that. If you want to listen to the `ondoctype` event, and then fetch the
doctypes, and read the entities and add them to `parser.ENTITIES`, then be my
guest.

## Documentation

The source code contains JSDOC comments. Use them.

**PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT IS PUBLIC AND WHAT IS PRIVATE.**

The elements of code that do not have JSDOC documentation, or have documentation
with the ``@private`` tag, are private.

If you use anything private, that's at your own peril.

If there's a mistake in the documenation, raise an issue. If you just assume,
you may assume incorrectly.

## Summary Usage Information

### Example

```javascript
var saxes = require("./lib/saxes"),
  parser = new saxes.SaxesParser();

parser.onerror = function (e) {
  // an error happened.
};
parser.ontext = function (t) {
  // got some text.  t is the string of text.
};
parser.onopentag = function (node) {
  // opened a tag.  node has "name" and "attributes"
};
parser.onattribute = function (attr) {
  // an attribute.  attr has "name" and "value"
};
parser.onend = function () {
  // parser stream is done, and ready to have more stuff written to it.
};

parser.write('<xml>Hello, <who name="world">world</who>!</xml>').close();
```

### Constructor Arguments

Pass the following arguments to the parser function. All are optional.

`opt` - Object bag of settings regarding string formatting.

Settings supported:

* `xmlns` - Boolean. If true, then namespaces are supported. Default
  is `false`.

* `position` - Boolean. If false, then don't track line/col/position. Unset is
  treated as `true`. Default is unset.

* `fileName` - String. Set a file name for error reporting. This is useful only
  when tracking positions. You may leave it unset, in which case the file name
  in error messages will be `undefined`.

### Methods

`write` - Write bytes onto the stream. You don't have to do this all at
once. You can keep writing as much as you want.

`close` - Close the stream. Once closed, no more data may be written until it is
done processing the buffer, which is signaled by the `end` event.

### Properties

The parser has the following properties:

`line`, `column`, `position` - Indications of the position in the XML document
where the parser currently is looking.

`closed` - Boolean indicating whether or not the parser can be written to.  If
it's `true`, then wait for the `ready` event to write again.

`opt` - Any options passed into the constructor.

`xmlDecl` - The XML declaration for this document. It contains the fields
`version`, `encoding` and `standalone`. They are all `undefined` before
encountering the XML declaration. If they are undefined after the XML
declaration, the corresponding value was not set by the declaration. There is no
event associated with the XML declaration. In a well-formed document, the XML
declaration may be preceded only by an optional BOM. So by the time any event
generated by the parser happens, the declaration has been processed if present
at all. Otherwise, you have a malformed document, and as stated above, you
cannot rely on the parser data!

### Events

To listen to an event, override `on<eventname>`. The list of supported events
are also in the exported `EVENTS` array.

See the JSDOC comments in the source code for a description of each supported
event.
